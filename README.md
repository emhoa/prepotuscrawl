Welcome to my Insight data engineering project

Written over the course of three weeks, this project has two goals. The first is to collect a count on the number of web pages that mention some of the presidential front-runners as of January/February 2016. The program uses data from the Common Crawl, which consists of more than 150 terabytes of data scrapped from 1.2 billion URIs during November 2015.

The sheer size of the data stored inside multi-line record format spread across 37,500 files presented the biggest engineering challenge.
